# Project journal for logseq-migration

Since I am about to cancel my roam subscription, I want to make sure that my assets (images, pdfs etc.) are stored 
locally in my `logseq` graph.

## Monday 06 June 2022

I found [this page](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210602-downloading-files-from-roam/)
and started to modify and refactor the code to work with `logseq`

## Tuesday 06 June 2022

I added tests, completed the refactoring, made the repo public and announced it on Twitter.

I cancelled my roam subscription.

## Wednesday 08 June 2022

I expanded the [README](../README.md) and added a [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)

## Friday 10 June 2022

I added an end-to-end test
