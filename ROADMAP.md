# Roadmap

The next steps are

1. Invite _beta-testers_.
2. Write an end-to-end test.
   1. ~~Create a test graph in roam,~~
      1. ~~with four linked nodes~~
      2. ~~and a pdf. a png and an mp4~~
   2. ~~export json~~
   3. ~~add it to this project~~
   4. ~~import using the instructions on the logseq hub~~
      1. pdf ref does not import. I suspect the format has changed.
   5. ~~copy the un-modified imported graph directory as test data in this project.~~
   6. ~~Write end run an end-to-end test that~~
      1. creates a test copy.
      2. localizes it using this software and
      3. checks the result
3. ~~Package the application for `PyPi` and update the instructions.~~
4. ~~add logging~~
5. Create a video for users - loom?
6. _Find a helpful collaborator_ who can help me set up GitHub actions to automate the tests!
7. Add type hints and docstring comments to all the code.
8. Generate documentation for collaborators.
